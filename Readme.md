#Rust Learning Path:
Here I will be pushing regular updates on my whole progress of learning Rust as my next programming language.
The reason why I chose Rust is due to it gaining popularity, even though it has been in my sights for quite some time already.
Another major reason is that I want to learn how to develop **Programs for the Solana network**
